Arrays contain groups of a value, there are declared using the syntax:
```
Type[] Name = { Value, Value...};
```
To access a value from an array take the name of the array, brackets, and the index like so.
```
int[] integers = {2,7,9};
integers[1];
```
Array indexes start at 0 because I am not a sadist.
