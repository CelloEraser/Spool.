Functions are the main way of manipulating data within Spool.
The syntax for a function is quite similar to that of a variable.
Return Type Name(TypeofArgument NameofArgument) = {
    WhatevertheFunctionDoes;
}; 
All functions are pure in Spool, they all take in an input and return an output.
Here is an example of function uses.
type int = -32768...32767{};
int square(int x) = {
return x*x;
};
int[] ints = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
int ThirdOperation(int[] intoids, int func operation) = {
    intoids[2] |> square |> return;
};
