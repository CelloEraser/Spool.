There are only a few conditional operators in Spool.
```
==, <, >, =<, >=, &=, and !=
```
"==" tests if the value on the right is the same as the value on the left.
"<" tests if the value on the left is less than the value on the right.
">" tests if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right.
"=<" tests if the value on the left is less or equal to the value on the right.
">=" tests if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right.
"&=" tests if the address of the value on the left is equal to the value on the right.
"!=" tests if the value on the left is different from the one on the right.
